## Quick Start

### For Users
1. **Basic Usage**: Food search works immediately with OpenFoodFacts and USDA databases
2. **Enhanced AI**: Configure AI providers in settings for image analysis
3. **Search Methods**: Use barcode, voice, text, or AI image analysis
4. **Results**: All methods integrate seamlessly with Loop's carb entry

### For Developers
1. **Core Services**: Located in `/Services/` directory
2. **UI Components**: Located in `/Views/` directory  
3. **Integration Point**: `CarbEntryView` and `CarbEntryViewModel`
4. **Provider Management**: `SearchProvider` enum and configuration system

## Key Features

- **Multiple Search Methods**: Barcode, voice, text, and AI image analysis
- **AI Provider Support**: OpenAI GPT-4o, Google Gemini Pro, Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- **USDA Integration**: Accurate serving size calculations and nutrition data
- **Real-time Telemetry**: Live analysis progress with 13-stage pipeline
- **Diabetes Optimization**: Carbohydrate-focused analysis for insulin dosing
- **Fallback Architecture**: Graceful degradation with multiple data sources

## Architecture Highlights

- **Service-Oriented Design**: Modular, maintainable components
- **Provider-Agnostic**: Easy to add new AI providers or data sources
- **Thread-Safe**: Proper async/await patterns with MainActor usage
- **Error-Resilient**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- **Performance-Optimized**: Streamlined AI prompts and optimized parameters

## Integration Benefits
